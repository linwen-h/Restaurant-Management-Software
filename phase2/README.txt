Project Phase 2 README


=== Project Description ===

This project runs within one instance. If you launch multiple instances of the project, they will fall out of sync,
or not run at all.

Additional Features:
    - Alerts system (Generic message board)
    - Login System
    - Login Encryption
    - Statistics based on how frequently an item is ordered
    - Current state of the current is backed-up upon closing.


=== Project Set-up ===

1. Clone the repo. In IntelliJ, select Import Project and select the folder phase2 as the project directory. Leave all other settings as default.

2. Right-click the folder phase2 in the explorer, select Add Framework Support, and tick Maven.

2.1 Go into pom.xml and enable auto import

2.2 All dependencies should now be downloaded and installed automatically.

3. Right-click the folder resources and mark the directory as resources root.

4. Edit your configurations to run from Login.main(), and change it to "Single Instance Only"

5. Before running the program, read the rest of the README file.

6. Run the program from Login.main()

NOTE: Sometimes intelliJ messes up with Maven projects and refuses to compile with resources.
      If you happen to get a NullPointerException, or it the project doesn't compile
      at all, delete your local copy, reset all IDE settings, re-clone the repo, and
      try to compile again.

      If it still doesn't work, I might have a fix for it, please email edt.chen@mail.utoronto.ca
      or call/text 778-838-2860. I guarantee it isn't a problem with our code, intelliJ is just screwy
      when it comes to importing projects.
